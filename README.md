this is a simple CRUD next.js app that tests building an api using the api routes

because of client side caching, changes are made to the data you are seeing, but the data that is being displayed is stale ( ex: I delete an item, I get redirected to the page that displays a list of items, the item I deleted only disappears after a HARD refresh )
